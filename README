What?
-----

oc is an ooc compiler written in ooc

Unlike rock, it doesn't attempt to satisfy everyone by adding hacks
to make everything work.

It doesn't even attempt to implement every ooc feature ever, but rather
find a subset of 'traditional ooc' that is coherent and convenient.

The goal is to make it as elegant as possible, with no unnecessary
code, with a good design, and avoiding hacks.
