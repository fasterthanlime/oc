FAQ
---

Q: Will there be syntax changes?
A: Maybe a few additions but that's all

Q: Does this mean I have to forget everything about ooc and learn it again?
A: No. This is the same language, just a better compiler for it.

Q: Aren't you going the D1/D2, Python2/3, Perl 5/6, etc. way?
A: No. Migrating from rock to oc will be a smooth transition - it's the same language.

Q: Is there a roadmap? How long before it becomes usable?
A: Between a few weeks and a few months. There's no official roadmap yet,
   but there may soon be, as soon as all the architecture is in place.
