# oc

oc is an [ooc](http://ooc-lang.org) compiler written in ooc. It focuses on clean design, flexibility and scalability. oc is planned to replace [rock](http://github.com/nddrylliog/rock), the current standard ooc compiler.

## About the transition

We are trying to make the eventual transition between rock and oc as smooth as possible. There will be almost no syntax changes to ooc itself. 

There isn't a roadmap yet, but oc should be in a usable state between now and a few months.
