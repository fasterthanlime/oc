# oc

oc is an [ooc][ooc] compiler written in ooc. It focuses on clean design,
flexibility and scalability.

oc was at some point planned to replace [rock][rock], the current standard ooc
compiler. But then life happened. Now it's mostly a fun playground.

[ooc]: http://ooc-lang.org
[rock]: http://github.com/nddrylliog/rock

## Building & installing

Get a functional rock by following instructions:

  * <http://ooc-lang.org/install/>

Then, just run:

> make

oc will be in `bin/oc`.

If you fancy a bit of a cleanup, run

> make clean
