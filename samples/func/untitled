Variable definition
===================

Always inferred, always initialized on declaration:

    <name>: <value>

E.g.

    answer: 42
    name: "Bozo the clown"

Function definition
===================

<name>: <args> -> <retType> <body>

<args> can be a tuple, ie. (a, b, c) or just a single name, or empty

<retType> can be left out.

<body> can either be a single statement, or a list of statements
enclosed in {}

-> can be left out if you're using {} for the body

Here are a few examples:

    quit: { "Bye!" println(); exit() }

    negate: a -> -a

    add: (a, b) -> a + b
